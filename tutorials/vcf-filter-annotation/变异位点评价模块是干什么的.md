# 变异位点评价模块是干什么的？

原文链接：[What do the VariantEval modules do? ](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=2361)

VariantEval accepts two types of modules: stratification and evaluation modules.

- Stratification modules will stratify (group) the variants based on certain properties.
- Evaluation modules will compute certain metrics for the variants

### CpG

CpG is a three-state stratification:

- The locus is a CpG site ("CpG")
- The locus is not a CpG site ("non_CpG")
- The locus is either a CpG or not a CpG site ("all")

A CpG site is defined as a site where the reference base at a locus is a C and the adjacent reference base in the 3' direction is a G.

### EvalRod

EvalRod is an N-state stratification, where N is the number of eval rods bound to VariantEval.

### Sample

Sample is an N-state stratification, where N is the number of samples in the eval files.

### Filter

Filter is a three-state stratification:

- The locus passes QC filters ("called")
- The locus fails QC filters ("filtered")
- The locus either passes or fails QC filters ("raw")

### FunctionalClass

FunctionalClass is a four-state stratification:

- The locus is a synonymous site ("silent")
- The locus is a missense site ("missense")
- The locus is a nonsense site ("nonsense")
- The locus is of any functional class ("any")

### CompRod

CompRod is an N-state stratification, where N is the number of comp tracks bound to VariantEval.

### Degeneracy

Degeneracy is a six-state stratification:

- The underlying base position in the codon is 1-fold degenerate ("1-fold")
- The underlying base position in the codon is 2-fold degenerate ("2-fold")
- The underlying base position in the codon is 3-fold degenerate ("3-fold")
- The underlying base position in the codon is 4-fold degenerate ("4-fold")
- The underlying base position in the codon is 6-fold degenerate ("6-fold")
- The underlying base position in the codon is degenerate at any level ("all")

See the [<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code#Degeneracy> Wikipedia page on degeneracy] for more information.

### JexlExpression

JexlExpression is an N-state stratification, where N is the number of JEXL expressions supplied to VariantEval. See [[Using JEXL expressions]]

### Novelty

Novelty is a three-state stratification:

- The locus overlaps the knowns comp track (usually the dbSNP track) ("known")
- The locus does not overlap the knowns comp track ("novel")
- The locus either overlaps or does not overlap the knowns comp track ("all")

### CountVariants

CountVariants is an evaluation module that computes the following metrics:

### CompOverlap

CompOverlap is an evaluation module that computes the following metrics:

| Metric          | Definition                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| nEvalSNPs       | number of eval SNP sites                 |
| nCompSNPs       | number of comp SNP sites                 |
| novelSites      | number of eval sites outside of comp sites |
| nVariantsAtComp | number of eval sites at comp sites (that is, sharing the same locus as a variant in the comp track, regardless of whether the alternate allele is the same) |
| compRate        | percentage of eval sites at comp sites   |
| nConcordant     | number of concordant sites (that is, for the sites that share the same locus as a variant in the comp track, those that have the same alternate allele) |
| concordantRate  | the concordance rate                     |

#### Understanding the output of CompOverlap

A SNP in the detection set is said to be 'concordant' if the position exactly matches an entry in dbSNP and the allele is the same. To understand this and other output of CompOverlap, we shall examine a detailed example. First, consider a fake dbSNP file (headers are suppressed so that one can see the important things):



As you can see, the detection set variant was listed under nVariantsAtComp (meaning the variant was seen at a position listed in dbSNP), but only the eval_correct_allele dataset is shown to be concordant at that site, because the allele listed in this dataset and dbSNP match.

### TiTvVariantEvaluator

TiTvVariantEvaluator is an evaluation module that computes the following metrics:

| Metric            | Definition                               |

| nTv               | number of transversion loci              |

| nTvInComp         | number of comp transversion sites        |
